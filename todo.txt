Kind of needed for launch
  % Current method of creating Remoteurls
    - Render Controller_Lanyard > Embed ?siteid/"site id no spaces"
        - CREATE iframe FINDS "site id no spaces" in Controller_RemoteUrl > SHOW if can't find it, it creates permalink "site_id_no_spaces" and redirects to permalink
        - Render _full_lanyard > shared/_recording find_by_permalink/"site id no spaces"
        ! To get these sync'ed up I would need to make_"var remoteurl_id"_into_permalink_slug in javascript prior to passing into _embed.js's full_lanyard   
  ! OR I can switch to permalink in lanyard_controller > EMBED

      
Not needed for launch
  % Enter email address > Email's access digits to email address + Confirmation of Info > Call number > Enter Pin # 
    % On email > DB table links > RemoteURL.id > Email Address > Name > Company > Pin # > Unpublished
    % Call number, enter PIN # > Twilio Links data from incoming PIN, updates recording record > Saves records
    - twilio rcvs call, request callinstructions.xml.erb > IT says enter 4 digits then # > sends to authconfirmed?.xml.erb
    - authconfirmed?.xml.erb checks DB for matching 4 digits in PIN column IF found > Record > Save > Update recordings table
    - If not found, disconnect after second attempt
    - helpful example http://www.twilio.com/docs/howto/weatherbyphone
    
  - auto increment site.permalink in case of duplicates  
  - Save css into field per site
